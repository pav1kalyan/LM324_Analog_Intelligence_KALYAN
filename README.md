# LM324_Analog_Intelligence_KALYAN
A collection of LM324-based analog companion modules designed for Arduino and embedded systems to expand the bandwidth of Products in Kalyan Labs and WnP.
# Analog Intelligence Modules

This repository documents the design and development of a family of
LM324-based analog companion modules intended to augment microcontrollers
such as Arduino with robust analog intelligence.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to move critical analog decision-making,
signal conditioning, and safety enforcement out of software and into
dedicated hardware modules.

## Scope
This repository includes:
- A standardized PCB template
- Multiple LM324-based analog modules
- Design documentation, schematics, and PCB layouts
- Testing methodology and results
